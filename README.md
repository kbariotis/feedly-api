feedly-api
=========
PHP wrapper around [Feedly's REST API](http://developer.feedly.com/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbariotis/feedly-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stakisko/feedly-api)

Notes
-----
Check the [examples](https://github.com/stakisko/feedly-api/blob/master/example) before anything.

If you are working in Sandbox mode of Feedly's API you should know a couple of things.

* Your Client's ID, secret must taken from [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/feedly-cloud/a_cGSAzv8bY), which is updated very often so be sure to check it once in while.
* While in Sandbox mode, only "http://localhost" is permited for callback url. So leave it as is and just replace it every time with your domain, if it's different. You can also add you own to permitted domains [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/feedly-cloud/vSo0DuShvDg/discussion).
* Once you've done developing you can contact Feedly and ask them to put you on [production](http://developer.feedly.com/v3/sandbox/).


Installation
-----------
Add this to your composer.json
```
"require": {
        "kbariotis/feedly-api": "dev-master"
    }
```

Or download the [ZIP](https://github.com/stakisko/feedly-api/archive/master.zip).

Documentation
-------------

**Constructor:**

```php
$feedly = new Feedly(Mode $mode, AccessTokenStorage $accessTokenStorage);
```

The `Mode` determines if you want to use the Sandbox mode (`SandBoxMode` class) or standard one (`DeveloperMode` class).

The `AccessTokenStorage` determines where the information about token should be stored. In example in session, file or database.

***Sandbox Example

```php
$feedly = new Feedly(new feedly\Mode\SandBoxMode(), new feedly\AccessTokenStorage\AccessTokenSessionStorage());
```

***Standard Mode Example

```php
$feedly = new Feedly(new feedly\Mode\DeveloperMode(), new feedly\AccessTokenStorage\AccessTokenSessionStorage());
```

**Authentication:**

Check the [example](https://github.com/stakisko/feedly-api/blob/master/example/authentication.php).

Note that not every Feedly action needs authentication. Passing a token is optional.
